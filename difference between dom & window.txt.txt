window object model 

* The Browser Object Model contains objects that represent the current browser window or tab
* The topmost object in the BOM is the window object representing the window or tab
* Window object has properties like browser history, location and the deviceâ€™s screen
* It is the top most object and outermost element of the object hierarchy
* In case of multi tab browser, a window object represents a single tab, but some of its properties like innerHeight                          innerWidth and methods like resizeTo() will affect the whole browser window

* When a web page is loaded, the browser creates a Document Object Model of the page
* The document object represents the whole html document as a tree of Objects html head body and other html tags
* It is the root element that represents the html document
* Each html document that gets loaded into a window becomes a document object
* The document contains the contents of the page Using document object JavaScript can modify add and delete the html elements attributes CSS styles in the page
* You can access a document object either using window document property or using document object directly as window is global object
* The other major difference is that both window object and document object have properties and methods
